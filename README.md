# Task-for-Junior-Software-Developer---Ensar-Hamza

This project is a simple URL shortener application. Users can input a long URL and generate a shortened version. The shortened URLs can be retrieved, viewed, and deleted. The project includes features such as expiration time for links and a click counter. The project was done with HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Node.Js, and MySql as the database. I have attached all the files needed to run the project.

Step 1:
Use Xampp to connect the database (database is provided in the repository)

Step 2:
Connect the server.js file with the database via node server.js command 

Step 3:
Use the localhost:5000/main.html url to access the project
